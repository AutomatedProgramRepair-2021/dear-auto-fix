Closure,7600137,gordon,n,Previous and succeeding statement are not included, I think it should be 320, 321, 322, 323
Closure,7900014,gordon,n,Line 121 is the successor statement, why do we include 140?
Closure,7900344,gordon,n,It's ok in terms of executable statements, but 221-222 would be fine for a developer as well.
Closure,8100229,gordon,n,Lines 519-520 could be included if we consider non-executable statements; statement 521 would be the successor
Closure,8400150,gordon,n,Lines 343+344 are non-executable but could be included; line 345 is the successor.
Closure,8900682,gordon,n,Successor statement missing (489)
